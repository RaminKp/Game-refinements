# Summer-Camo
In this project we are refining a number of games from UNBC Social Robotics class of 2025 to be implemented on QTrobot for children between the age of 6 to 12. The goal is to run a study and find out about children's learning outcomes and children's behavior towards the robot as this study falls into the "Robots in the wild" category.
